# Expression Evaluator
A simple command line calculator written in C++ that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponents, and trigonometric functions.
There are two iterations of the calculator, with one using OOP principles with interfaces and another that use objects but uses a more procedural approach to the program. This project is meant as practice working with C++.
